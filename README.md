# Twitch-Modem-Bot
TwitchModemBot monitors your network interfaces in real time and runs speed tests via Twitch chat commands. It reports TX/RX speeds, connection status, and stability for multiple ISPs. Moderators can trigger speed tests, view historical results, and get alerts on connectivity changesâ€”all directly in Twitch chat.
